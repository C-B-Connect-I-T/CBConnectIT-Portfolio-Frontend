Dabbled quiet a bit with Ionic and Xamarin in the early days of my career but quickly focussed on Native Development. \n\nTo keep consitency between Android and iOS on some projects, I also checked out some Swift code and am able to understand quiet a bit about the project setup.\n\nAlso interested in checking out the \"newer kids on the block\" like Flutter and KMP to see what the benefits of both platforms/frameworks are and to make an educated decission when setting up a new project.",

        "description": "Professionally working with the Android Framework since 2017, working on it as a hobbyist well before that. Touched a lot of the Framework during my career, ranging from the standard things like fetching and showing data to working with the Bluetooth and WiFi API. Also, I am no stranger to creating custom views using the Material Design System as a basis.\n\nIn order to increase my output while working on multiple projects for a client I also created a library which contained a lot of default classes and provided a basis for a project setup. This made it easier to switch between projects.\n\nI have experience in working with the default XML layout system but also jumped on the Compose train and noticed what all the hype about it was. Recently started trying out KMP to check whether it is something I want to learn more about.",
